There are several types of carp. Sazan a wild variety of carp, living mostly in rivers, has a full scale and a much slender body structure than other carp. Sometimes anglers just starting their adventure with fish may confuse him with amur. The latter, apart from a different body structure, different arrangement of eyes, does not have a mustache. Commonly known and common forms of carp arose as a result of centuries-old farming practices. The most popular are: full-bodied carp, mirrors and knuckle. The first differs from sazan mainly in strong bite, which is why it can also be identified with wild carp. The mirrors are also heavily curved, but they have very few, just a few rows of large scales. Golec, as the name suggests, is almost completely deprived of them.

Carps prefer deeper places, but on warmer days they will not despise the shallows, where they can bask. In the rivers, he searches for quiet coves, reverse currents. Its presence can often be recognized by the appearance of gas bubbles, by the movements of the reeds, caused by squeezing between them a powerful trunk, and by munching and smacking, accompanying the collection of food from the water surface.',
